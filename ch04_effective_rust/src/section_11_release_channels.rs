//!
//!  There are three channels for Rust releases:
//!         Nightly
//!         Beta
//!         Stable
//!
//! Generally speaking, unless you have a specific reason, you should be using the stable release
//! channel. These releases are intended for a general audience.
//
//! However, depending on your interest in Rust, you may choose to use nightly instead. The basic
//! trade-off is this: in the nightly channel, you can use unstable, new Rust features. However,
//! unstable features are subject to change, and so any new nightly release may break your code.
//! If you use the stable release, you cannot use experimental features, but the next release of Rust
//! will not cause significant issues through breaking changes.
